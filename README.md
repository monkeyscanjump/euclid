# Euclid: A StencilJS Component Library for the Euclid Protocol

[](https://www.google.com/search?q=LICENSE)

This repository ([https://github.com/monkeyscanjump/euclid](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://github.com/monkeyscanjump/euclid)) contains a framework-agnostic, modular component library for interacting with the Euclid Protocol, built with StencilJS.

This project is not a web application. It is a set of compiled, standards-based **Web Components** designed to run in *any* frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML).

## Our Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not a Monolithic App

The Euclid Protocol is a multi-chain, open standard. The tools to interact with it should be, too.

Modern web development has converged on a stack (React/Next.js, Zustand/TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS) that prioritizes developer convenience for building a *single application* over the long-term, open, and performant infrastructure a *protocol* deserves.

This is a stack of compromises, "noise," and "slop." We reject it.

We are building clean, fast, and reusable infrastructure based on web standards.

-----

### 1\. Our Answer to Framework Lock-in (React, Next.js)

Choosing a framework like Next.js to build *protocol infrastructure* is a critical error. It locks the entire ecosystem into a single framework.

  * **Our Solution:** We use **StencilJS**. It compiles our components to standards-based Web Components. We build *one* component (e.g., `<euclid-swap-card>`) and it runs natively in **all** frameworks. This is the only way to build open infrastructure.

### 2\. Our Answer to Framework "Noise" (Zustand, TanStack Query)

Framework-locked apps force the import of a stack of "noise" libraries (like Zustand or TanStack Query) just to solve problems that the framework itself creates.

  * **Our Solution:** We are self-contained. Our library includes its own headless **"Controller" components** and a minimal **`@stencil/store`**.
      * **Caching:** Our `<euclid-market-data-controller>` handles it.
      * **Polling:** Our `<euclid-swap-controller>` handles its *own* "smart poll" for routes.
      * **State:** Our `wallet.store` is the "Address Book." It's built-in, not an external dependency.

We don't import noise. We write clean logic.

### 3\. Our Answer to Utility-First "Slop" (Tailwind CSS)

Utility-first CSS frameworks are an **abomination** for large-scale, performant applications. They are an excuse for not building a proper design system.

They prioritize developer convenience while forcing the user to suffer. The result is HTML "slop"â€”bloated, unreadable markup polluted with thousands of class strings, increasing download size and render times.

  * **Our Solution:** We are building a **real, performant design system**. We use Stencil's **scoped CSS** (`shadow: true`) for every component.
      * **Clean DOM:** Our components are minimal (e.g., `<euclid-swap-card>`). The HTML is semantic and free of class-string pollution.
      * **High Performance:** The user downloads a single, small, optimized CSS bundle. Component styles are encapsulated.
      * **Maintainable:** We write clean, consistent, component-scoped CSS. This is how you build fast, reactive applications, not slop.

## Core Architecture & Multi-Chain Logic

### 1\. The "Address Book" (Not a "Login")

We have no concept of a single "logged-in" wallet. A single-chain login is a broken UX pattern for a multi-chain protocol.

Instead, we use a central global store (`wallet.store`) that functions as an **"Address Book"**. This store holds a `Map<ChainUID, WalletInfo>` for *every* wallet the user has connected. This is the single source of truth for all signers.

### 2\. The Provider Pattern (`<euclid-core-provider>`)

To make this library modular, a developer **must** wrap their application in the `<euclid-core-provider>`. This single component is the "brain" that renders all headless controllers and initializes the global state.

### 3\. Contextual Actions (No More Forced Logins)

Our UI components are "dumb." The action buttons (like "Swap") are intelligent and contextual.

1.  A user selects a "From" token (e.g., USDC on Ethereum).
2.  The `<euclid-swap-card>` component checks the `wallet.store` (Address Book) for an Ethereum wallet.
3.  **If no signer is found:** The button displays "Connect Ethereum Wallet."
4.  **If a signer is found:** The button displays "Swap."

The user is only prompted to connect the *specific* wallet they *need*, exactly when they need it.

### 4\. The Intelligent Wallet Modal (`<euclid-wallet-modal>`)

We have **one single, intelligent modal** for managing wallets. Its behavior is controlled by the `app.store.walletModalFilter` state, which is set by *what* component calls it.

1.  **Manager Mode:** When opened by a *general* component (like the optional `<euclid-wallet-manager-button>` in a header), the filter is set to `null`. The modal reacts by showing the full Address Book.
2.  **Filtered Mode:** When opened by an *action* (like the `<euclid-swap-card>`), the filter is set to the required chain (e.g., `'ethereum'`). The modal reacts by showing only options for that specific chain.

## How to Use (For Developers)

This library is designed to be plug-and-play.

### 1\. Installation

```bash
# This package will be published to NPM, e.g.:
npm install @monkeyscanjump/euclid
```

### 2\. Step 1: Wrap Your App (Example in Next.js `layout.tsx`)

You **must** wrap your application in the `<euclid-core-provider>`.

```javascript
// In your main layout file (e.g., layout.tsx, _app.tsx, index.html)
// Import the library (this registers all components)
import '@monkeyscanjump/euclid';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <euclid-core-provider>
          {/* All your application's routes and components go here */}
          {children}
        </euclid-core-provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 3\. Step 2: Use Feature Components (Example in a `/swap` page)

Use any feature component. It will automatically connect to the provider and work.

```javascript
// In your swap page (e.g., /pages/swap.tsx)
// No other imports are needed.

export default function SwapPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Custom Swap Page</h1>
      <euclid-swap-card></euclid-swap-card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Development & Sandbox

This project includes an `index.html` file that serves as a development sandbox for testing all components in isolation.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the dev server:**

    ```bash
