# VSL Components
 ![Factory Architecture](../../../../static/img/components-1.jpg)

The VSL is composed of two main parts:

- [Virtual Liquidity Pools (VLP)](../Virtual%20Settlement%20Layer/virtual-pools.md): The VSL is responsible for performing all calculations related to swaps for its token pair.
- [Virtual Balances](../Virtual%20Settlement%20Layer/virtual-balances.md): Virtual Balance keeps track of all the balances of users and VLPs making sure nothing is ever lost.
