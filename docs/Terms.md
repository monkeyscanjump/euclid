# Terms of Service

## 1.  Introduction
    
Welcome to **Euclid Protocol** (“**Euclid**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”). These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of Euclid’s decentralized liquidity protocol, related applications, APIs, websites, dashboards, documentation, and any other services provided by Euclid (collectively, the “**Services**”).

By accessing or using the Services, you (“**you**”, or the “**User**”) agree to be bound by these terms, along without _**Privacy Policy**_ and any applicable product-specific terms, schedules or annexes. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. 

Purpose
-------

Euclid provides experimental, blockchain-based software infrastructure that allows users to interact with decentralized smart contracts. The Services are provided on “as is” and “as available” basis and may be subject to technological, financial or regulatory risks. 

Updates & Modifications
-----------------------

We may update or modify these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g by posting the updated Terms on our website or within our Services). Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. 

Important Notice
----------------

Nothing in these Terms (or in the Services) constitutes investment, legal or financial advice. Tokens and smart contracts deployed through Euclid may fluctuate in value and carry a high risk of loss, and you are solely responsible for understanding and accepting these risks before use.

1.  **No Guarantee of Availability:** Euclid makes no representation or warranty that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or continuously available. 
    

1.  **Third-Party Dependencies:** Certain functionalities of the Services may rely upon a third-party provider (including wallets, custodians, exchanges, infrastructure services, oracles or data providers). Euclid disclaims all responsibility for the actions, omissions, or failures of such third parties. 
    

4.3 **Right to Modify or Discontinue** 

Euclid reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without liability or prior notice, to:

*   Require additional conditions or restrictions for continued access to the Services.
    

## 5.  Use of Tokens
    

5.1 **General Disclaimer**

The Services may support, display or route transactions involving cryptographic tokens, digital assets, or other blockchain-based instruments (collectively, “**Tokens**”). These Tokens may include: (i) tokens native to Euclid Protocol, (ii) third-party tokens integrated into liquidity pools or routing layers, and (iii) governance or utility tokens from other protocols. Euclid does not issue, endorse, or guarantee the value, functionality or legality of any Token, except as expressly disclosed with respect to Euclid’s own native token(s). 

5.2 **No Investment Advice or Guarantee of Value** 

Tokens accessible through the Services are not **securities, investments, or financial products** unless expressly classified as such under applicable law. Nothing in these Terms, nor any content provided by Euclid, constitutes financial, investment, legal or tax advice. 

*   No Token is guaranteed to maintain any particular value. 
    
*   No Token should be purchased or held with expectation of profit, dividends, or economic return.
    
*   Prices and liquidity are determined by decentralized markets and may be volatile or subject to manipulation.

You are solely responsible for: 

1.  Determining whether your acquisition, holding, or use of any Token complies with the laws of your jurisdiction. 
    

1.  Bearing all risks associated with Tokens, including technological risk (e.g smart contract vulnerabilities, bugs, forks) and market risk (e.g volatility, liquidity shortage). 
    

1.  Understanding that transactions are **irreversible** once confirmed on the relevant blockchain. 
    

5.4 **Euclid’s Limited Role**

5.5 **Native Euclid Tokens** 

Where Euclid deploys its own native token(s), such token(s) shall serve only as **utility instruments** within the Euclid Protocol and associated ecosystem. Such tokens do not represent equity, debt, ownership, voting rights (except where expressly provided for governance), or any claim to revenue, profits, or assets of Euclid or its affiliates. 

5.6 **Restricted Tokens and Jurisdictions**

Certain tokens may be restricted, prohibited, or unavailable for use in particular jurisdictions due to regulatory or policy reasons. Euclid reserves the right to **restrict or block access** to specific Tokens through its interfaces at its sole discretion. Euclid does not have the ability or authority to delist tokens from decentralized markets directly. 

## 6.  Risk Disclosures
