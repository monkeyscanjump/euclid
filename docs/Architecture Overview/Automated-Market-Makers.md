# Automated Market Makers

An **Automated Market Maker** (AMM) allow digital assets to be traded without permission by using liquidity pools instead 
of a traditional market of buyers and sellers (an orderbook). 

AMMs are powered by liquidity providers, that provide a pair of assets to a pool that sets the price and liquidity of a certain pool.

You can read more about AMMs [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers).

## Constant Product Market Makers 

A Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) is an AMM algorithm that was initially designed and created by Uniswap where the algorithm
aims to keep a constant ratio of assets in a pool. The constant is usually denoted as `k` and is defined as the product of the number of each asset in the pool: 

$$
 k = x * y
$$  

CPMMs ensure that a pool cannot be drained of a certain asset, unlike [Constant Sum Market Makers](https://members.delphidigital.io/learn/constant-sum-automated-market-maker-csamm). This leads to what is called execution slippage, which is the difference between the **actual price** (ratio of assets), and the price at which a trade is executed.

#### Example

If a trader wants to swap 10 X tokens for Y tokens in this pool, the amount of Y tokens that the trader receives can be calculated using the formula:

$$ x \cdot y = k $$

Given:
$$ x = 100, \, y = 100 $$
$$ X \cdot Y = 10,000 $$

The calculation for Y tokens is:

$$ Y = \frac{10,000}{X} = \frac{10,000}{(100 + 10)} = \frac{10,000}{110} \approx 90.9 $$

According to the k-constant, the pool should contain 90.9 Y tokens. Consequently, the trader should receive the difference of:

 $$ 100 - 90.9 = 9.1 Y $$ tokens

The trader receives 9.1 Y tokens instead of the expected 10 Y tokens based on a 1:1 price ratio in the pool (1X = 1Y). This variance between expected and received tokens is the slippage.



### Limitations

Currently, a CPMM pool relies solely on the assets in the pool smart contract in order to calculate the price and the slippage of the transaction. This creates what we call an **_inefficient_** market, since the smart contract does not have access to all the market information outside of its own component.

This means that although \$20,000,000 of liquidity can exist outside of a smart contract for this pair across the blockchain, if the pair has \$200 of liquidity, the slippage and inefficient pricing make it unusable.

### Euclid's Solution

Euclid aggregates liquidity from multiple token reserves across various blockchains, creating a unified pool for each token pair. This significantly increases the depth of liquidity, reduces slippage, and enables more efficient trading.

#### Example
Assuming Euclid is connected to just 2 pools, each having 100 X and 100 Y tokens, the same trader mentioned above would get the following for the same transaction on an exchange using the Euclid layer:

$$ x \cdot y = k $$

Given:
$$ x = 200, \, y = 200 $$
$$ X \cdot Y = 40,000 $$

The calculation for Y tokens is:

$$ Y = \frac{40,000}{X} = \frac{40,000}{(200 + 10)} = \frac{40,000}{210} \approx 190.45 $$

This will result in the trader receiving:

$$ Y = 200 - 190.45 = 9.55 \, \text{Y tokens} $$ which is a 50% decrease in slippage.
